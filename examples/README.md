# Examples
This folder contains multiple examples on how to use this library.

## Executing the examples
These examples assume that `luasm.lua` is in the same directory as the example itself.

This means that you have to first copy `src/luasm.lua` into this directory.
Then you should be able to execute these examples with `lua <example_name>` inside this directory.
